# Troublesome terms

Lead: TBC

**Stratum / Unit / Formation**.
Clarify correct terms that we should use (engineers are pretty bad at this).
**Unit** used by OGC, Leapfrog, BGS.
*Stratum rarely found in search of relevant technical sites. Suggest using Unit, not stratum.*

**Factual data**.
(NCC- this is my thinking - not checked for existing definitions)
The record of observations and measurements relating to the ground
*(made in situ, remotely or in a laboratory)*.
In order to comply with reporting requirements, a limited degree of processing and/or interpretation of the original observations and
measurements may be required, e.g. derivation of reported results from test measurements.

**Interpretation**.
Process of....

**Interpreted data/information?**.
(NCC- this is my thinking - not checked for existing definitions) Information, including but not limited to properties or parameters, collated and/or derived from factual data.
Interpretation should take into account the provenance of the factual data, correlation with other data, knowledge of expected conditions,  established relationships, uncertainty and intended use of the data.
Interpretation may undertaken in several stages, e.g. (i) interpretation of anticipated geological profile followed by (ii) interpretation of a profile and parameters suitable for use in design.

**Conceptual (data) model/schema**
NCC: We have already used conceptual model. what are we (IDBE) trying to deliver. Is it a data model? Model vs Schema probably not important.
LandInfra example http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/landinfra.


**Borehole.**
NCC: Investigations comprise much more than boreholes- we need a more generic parent terms (then borehole can be correctly used as a particular type of investigation.

Options: Exploratory Hole (or Point or Profile or Location or ?), or Investigation Point (or Hole or Profile or Location or?)

**Ground investigation or site investigation (or survey).**
NCC: We (sort of) have a definition in the uk, albeit the terms are still often incorrectly used.

**American or English English!**
e.g. standardisation or standardization
NCC: I think ISO uses American English (check) so, reluctantly, I will concede this one!

**Property/Parameter.**

NCC: Propose adopting *Property* being, for example, a value reported from a test (directly measured, or based on interpreted measurement) that is typically reported in a factual GI report. A *Parameter* is then a single property (or a profile related to an independent variable) selected after interpretation to be representative of the property applicable for particular feature for a particular purpose, typically for use as input to design.

NCC: Related question: is a (non numeric) observation a property? Note that a parameter need not be numeric, e.g. in my design reports I may define whether a clayey soil should be consider as 'drained' or 'undrained'. SImilarly would regard a code used for soil classificaiton to be a property, not observation. The full lithological description may be considred to be an observation (or is it?)

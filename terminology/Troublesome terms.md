# Troublesome terms

Lead: TBC

**Ground model.**
NCC: My preference was to use this as a parent term covering all types of model.
However, this term has a narrower meaning in EC7 (for modelling existing ground only, with geotechnical model used for 'design' models).

**Borehole.**
NCC: Investigations comprise much more than boreholes- we need a more generic parent terms (then borehole can be correctly used as a particular type of investigation.

**Ground investigation or site investigation (or survey).**
NCC: We (sort of) have a definition in the uk, albeit the terms are still often incorrectly used.

**American or English English!**
e.g. standardisation or standardization
NCC: I think ISO uses American English (check) so, reluctantly, I will concede this one!

**Property/Parameter.**

NCC: Propose adopting *Property* being, for example, a value reported from a test (directly measured, or based on interpreted measurement) that is typically reported in a factual GI report. A *Parameter* is then a single property (or a profile related to an independent variable) selected after interpretation to be representative of the property applicable for particular feature for a particular purpose, typically for use as input to design.

NCC: Related question: is a (non numeric) observation a property? Note that a parameter need not be numeric, e.g. in my design reports I may define whether a clayey soil should be consider as 'drained' or 'undrained'. SImilarly would regard a code used for soil classificaiton to be a property, not observation. The full lithological description may be considred to be an observation (or is it?)

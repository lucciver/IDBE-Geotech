# Troublesome terms

Lead: TBC

**Ground model.**
NCC: My preference was to use this as a parent term covering all types of model.
However, this term has a narrower meaning in EC7 (for modelling existing ground only, with geotechnical model used for 'design' models).

**Borehole.**
NCC: Investigations comprise much more thatn boreholes- we need a more generic parent terms (then borehol can be correclty used as a particualr type of investigation.

**Ground investigation or site investigation (or survey).**
NCC: We (sort of) have a definition in the uk, albeit the terms are still often incorrectly used.

**American or English English!**
e.g. standardisation or standardization
NCC: I think ISO uses American English (check) so, reluctantly, I will concede this one!

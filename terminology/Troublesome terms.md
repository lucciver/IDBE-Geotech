# Troublesome terms

Lead: TBC

**Ground? model.**

We need a parent (all encompassing) term to cover ALL types of model. My preference was to use 'ground model'.
However, this term has a narrower meaning in drat update for EC7: "(for modelling existing ground only, with geotechnical model used for 'design' models).

Options:

Geotechnical model : NO. Implies 'design'. Also too narrow (geology and hydrogeology are not subsets of geotechnical)

Geomodel: NO. 'Geo' can be geographic i.e. on surface as well as below surface).


**Borehole**. 
NCC: Investigations comprise much more thatn boreholes- we need a more generic parent terms (then borehol can be correclty used as a particualr type of investigation.

**Ground investigation or site investigation (or survey).**
NCC: We (sort of) have a definition in the uk, albeit the terms are still often incorrectly used.

**American or English English!**
e.g. standardisation or standardization
NCC: I think ISO uses American English (check) so, reluctantly, I will concede this one!

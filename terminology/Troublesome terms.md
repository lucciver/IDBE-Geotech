# Troublesome terms

Lead: TBC

**Stratum / Unit / Formation**.
Clarify correct terms that we should use (engineers are pretty bad at this).

*NCC: (geological) Unit used by OGC, Leapfrog, BGS and others. Geotechnical unit by EC7. 
Stratum rarely found in search of relevant technical sites. Suggest we should not use stratum or stratigraphy.
Suggest use --> XXX Unit where XXX is domain

For geology, a unit may be a Group, Formation or Bed - depends on what modeller wants to represent*

**Ground? model.**

We need a parent (all encompassing) term to cover ALL types of model. See Working Draft section.

**Borehole**. 
NCC: Investigations comprise much more thatn boreholes- we need a more generic parent terms (then borehol can be correclty used as a particualr type of investigation.

Options: Exploratory Hole (or Point or Profile or Location or ?), or Investigation Point (or Hole or Profile or Location or?)

**Ground investigation or site investigation (or survey).**
NCC: We (sort of) have a definition in the uk, albeit the terms are still often incorrectly used.

**American or English English!**
e.g. standardisation or standardization
NCC: I think ISO uses American English (check) so, reluctantly, I will concede this one!

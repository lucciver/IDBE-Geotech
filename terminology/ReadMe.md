# Getting started with Github

If you have go this far then you have already figured out how to browse through the folders.

To be able to edit docs on here you need to:
1. Create a Github account. This is very easy - see top right of screen.
2. Email <ssimmons@opengeospatial.org> to request access to this (IDBE) repository with your Github ID.
3. It may take a day or tow for Scott to respond.

To edit docs there are two basic methods:
+ Edit via this webpage
+ Use Github desktop app, possibly also using Atom as an editor

There are other methods, but they sound more complicated to me.

For what we are doing at the start of this task this way of working
is perhaps a little bit cumbersome. However, as we progress
and we are playing around with proposed definitions, where we may want
to have a 'review' system, then this may turn out to be really good.
Lets see how it goes.

## Edit via this webpage

Simply click on the pencil button top right of preview window.

The text editor opens up (the content will now look a bit different - see the section below on Markdown)

Click on the button at the bottom to save

# Categories of terms
Lead: Neil Chadwick
But anyone in terminology task team is welcome to add/edit

## Scope
Terms anticipated to be required to support and inform development of the conceptual schema for ground/geotechnical data.
To include terms describing schema, models, components of models and project workflows. To include general terms relating to site/ground investigation, but this phase of work will not attempt to define terms for individual geotechnical tests or parameters.

## Suggested categories

**Schema definition.**
Clarify the technical terms relevant to data schema development and deifiaiton. These will be pre-existing terms in common use,
but it may be helpful to restate and possibly clarify these.

**Model & types of model.**
Define what we mean by model, and the different types of model we might consider.

**Domains / Subject areas**
The different ground related disciplines. These are well known and well defined to most of us in our part of the industry, but less so to others in construction. e.g. geotechnical engineer vs geologist vs engineering geologist. Definitions maybe not essential here, but I think it would be helpful to include them.

**Components of a model.**
e.g. geological unit

**Phases / Elements of a workflow / project.**
Consider the flow through desk study, ground investigation, factual data, interpretation, design, construction, monitoring.
Also terms used worldwide for different project stages, e.g. feasibility, concept design, scheme design, detailed design.

**Properties / Parameters.**
Define headings, but individual properties/parameters out of scope for Phase 1?

**Ground investigation.**
'Hole' and 'Test' types, reporting, other elements?

# Categories of terms
Lead: Neil Chadwick
But anyone in terminology task team is welcome to add/edit

## Scope
To be confirmed. Scope should naturally develop from identifying relevant categories

## Suggested categories

**Phases / Elements of a workflow / project.**
Consider the flow through desk study, ground investigation, factual data, interpretation, design, construction, monitoring. Also terms used worldwide for different project stages, e.g. feasibility, concept design, scheme design, detailed design.

**Model & types of model.**
Define what we mean by model, and the different types of model we might consider.

**Parts of a model.**
e.g. geological unit

**Properties / Parameters.**
Define headings, but individual properties/parameters out of scope for Phase 1?

**Ground investigation.**
'Hole' types, reporting, other elements?

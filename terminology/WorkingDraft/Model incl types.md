## ????? Model ##

The following are from draft revision to EC7:

3.1.1.13 **geotechnical unit**: volume of ground or ground layer that is defined as a single material in a Geotechnical Design Model

3.1.1.14 **Ground Model** model of the ground based on results from ground investigations and other available data

NC: I wanted to use this term to include design models too, but this would clash.

3.1.1.15 **Geotechnical Design Model**: ground information for engineering design purposes developed for a particular design situation and limit state




GeoSciML has the object 'GeologicUnit', which can be of a type from this this:

Note that 'Geologic unit' seems to be used as a generic term.

## ????? Model ##

The following are from draft revision to EC7:

3.1.1.13 **geotechnical unit**: volume of ground or ground layer that is defined as a single material in a Geotechnical Design Model

3.1.1.14 **Ground Model** model of the ground based on results from ground investigations and other available data

NC: I wanted to use this term to include design models too, but this would clash.

3.1.1.15 **Geotechnical Design Model**: ground information for engineering design purposes developed for a particular design situation and limit stat

From:

The Observational Engineering Geological Model. These are typically 
created from information generated during the site-specific ground 
investigation and are constrained by observational and measured data and 
should present geological information in space or time. They should verify 
or refine the conceptual engineering geological model. In particular, they 
should focus on potential engineering issues identified in the conceptual 
engineering geological model but about which little or nothing is known 
for the specific site.  Observational engineering geological models are 
particularly relevant at the engineering design stage. Later stage 
verification and refinement of the observational engineering geological 
model should take place during construction. If observational models are 
developed initially using high quality conceptual models, the uncertainties 
associated with observational models should be reduced. However, the 
derivation of an appropriate observational model is still dependent upon 
the knowledge and experience of those involved. 
 
The Analytical Model. This model is used to interpret how the ground is 
likely to behave when it is impacted by the engineered project during the 
construction process. Analytical models are likely to vary considerably 
depending upon the nature of the ground, itself, and the particular 
engineering process being applied. Engineering geological parameters 
such as shear strength, hydraulic conductivity, and deformation modulus 
have to be understood and provided in a suitably simplified but realistic 
framework for analysis, i.e. in terms of their distribution within the 
observational models.

This doc also has a definition (on page 9) of 'Ground model' same as eng geol model but includes parameters.

Suggest:

**(Observational) (Engineering) Geological model** for interpreted models.
Any parameters included 'should' be informative, e.g. summary of observed data, rather than for design
Ground model is alternative term (but best avoid as its ambigious). 
Also avoid using 'geotechnical model model' for this.
Note also that it may not be Geological (e.g. hydrogeological)

**Analytical model** for any type of model ready to be used in design or analysis.
@Design' model acceptable altnrative.  Geotechncail design model also ok, and ties in with EC7.

We still don't have an overall  ?? model term (ground domain model - yuk!)

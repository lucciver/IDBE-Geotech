# Model

## Model general concepts

### Model

In the context of this lexicon, a digital visual representation of data.

***Note:*** *The model may be 3D, e.g. volume model, or 2D, e.g. GIS based plan, ***Jonas:*** or even without a defined geometric representation (conceptual model, see below)*




### Ground model or geomodel?

A digital visual representation of ground related data.
In the context of this lexicon, this term is an all-encompassing/umbrella term used to describe any type of digital visual model 
in the ground domain, including conceptual, observational and analytical models.

***Note (if we use ground model):*** 
*It is recognised that some Codes and publications* 
*define ground model more narrowly, e.g. Eurocode 7 reserves the term for an observational* 
*model. However, for clarity it is useful define an umbrella term for models in the ground* 
*domain and it has been decided that, in the absence of an acceptable suitable concise* 
*alternative, ground model may be adopted.*

***Jonas:***
*We assume that the "ground domain" includes the natural ground (and/including anthropogenic land fill?) and excludes artificial structures like buildings, ground improvement etc., right? I think we should state this somewhere*

### Subsurface model
A model of man-made structures or infrastructure within the ground, either existing or proposed.
A ground model/geomodel *(delete as applicable)* may be incorporated within the subsurface model. 

### Category (of model)
Conceptual, observational or analytical, as defined below.

### Domain (of model)
A specified sphere of activity or knowledge. In the context of this lexicon, domain may include ground (parent domain), geology, hydrogeology,  geoenvironmental and geotechnical.
* ***Jonas:*** This is in line with the usage of the term "domain" in IFC, although Nicks current proposal does not use "ground" but "geotechnics", which is to our understanding just a "sub-domain".
We can also note that there are "parent" and "sub"-domains. These terms are good for our communication now, although I am not sure if we should aim to define a strict hirarchie, in the end (conceptual model task).*

### Type (of model)
Concise definition incorporating the category and domain of the model., and any further definition that may be required.
Use of the formally defined category and domain names is preferred, but some acceptable alternative terms.

### Name (of model)
Concise title that incorporates the model type and any other key information required to define the model within the context it is to be used, e.g. within a project.

### Specified purpose (of model)
The intended and/or permitted usage of the model. May incorporate excluded uses where appropriate. Examples: (i) Visualisation of geology only; not to be used for design, (ii) EC7 design of foundations.


## Categories of model

### Conceptual model
Abstract description of a system, such as geology or hydrogeology, based on understanding of local and regional processes and relationships.

### Observational model
Model predominantly based on observations and measurements of the ground. This may incorporate interpretation of anticipated conditions in areas between the observation and measurement points. Generally not suitable for direct use in analysis or design without further interpretation. Observational models should be developed from a conceptual model.

### Analytical model
Model suitable for direct use in analysis or design for a specified purpose. Normally based on development and interpretation of an observational model taking into account uncertainty, requirements of Codes and analysis/design methodology.
* *** Jonas: *** purpose-specific simplification of observational model, resolution, distinct parameter sets for calculations instead of ranges etc.*

## Types of model

### Geological model
Acceptable abbreviated description for an engineering geology observational model. This model will show the anticipated location and extent of geological units and other geological features.

### Geotechnical design model
Acceptable alternative description for a geotechnical analytical model intended for use in design. This model will define, for the specified purpose only, the location and extent of geological/geotechnical units and parameters.

### Geotechnical model
Non-preferred abbreviated form of geotechnical design model.

### Hydrogeological model
Acceptable abbreviated description for an hydrogeological observational model. This model will show the anticipated location and extent of hydrogeological units, e.g. aquifers.

* ***Jonas:*** In hydrogeology, the term "hydrogeological model" is strongly related to numerical modelling (e.g. Modflow or FeFlow, "Hydrogeological Simulation, see proposed defintion below) and often used synonymously. Such application would be "analytical models". 
Anyway, I agree to the here proposed definition as it is consistent with the geological model (and other, like geophysical etc. can be used). But we need clear definitions of both.
On the other hand, analytical models for hydrogeology are often derived directly from the geological observational model.

### Hydrogeological Simulation
Poposed alternative description for a hydrogeological analytical model (numerical model, finite elements/differences), to be distinguished from "hydrogeological observational models"

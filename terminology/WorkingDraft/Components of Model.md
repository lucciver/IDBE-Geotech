8.4.1.3   **GeologicUnit**
Conceptually, a GeologicUnit may represent a body of material in the Earth whose complete and precise extent is inferred to exist 
(e.g., North American Data Model GeologicUnit [12], Stratigraphic unit in the sense of NACSN [14], or International Stratigraphic Code [9]),
or a classifier used to characterize parts of the Earth 
(e.g. lithologic map unit like ‘granitic rock’ or ‘alluvial deposit’, surficial units like ‘till’ or ‘old alluvium’). 
It includes both formal units (i.e. formally adopted and named in an official lexicon) and informal units 
(i.e. named but not promoted to a lexicon) 
and unnamed units 
(i.e., recognizable, described and delineable in the field but not otherwise formalised).  
In simpler terms, a geologic unit is a package of earth material (generally rock).
